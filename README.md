#-Smart-Restaurant-Bot


In this project, I have utilized Watson Assistant, Text to Speech, Cloudant DB for storing customer details, and Node-RED for the user interface.

This bot interacts with customers by asking for their basic details such as name, email ID, and phone number. It also has the capability to display the menu and daily offers.

The bot can take customer orders and notify them when their order is ready. All customer details and interactions are stored in the Cloudant database. This allows the restaurant to access the information to process orders and gather customer feedback. Once the restaurant confirms that an order is complete, the bot will automatically notify the customer that their order is ready.
